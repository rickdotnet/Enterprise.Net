# Enterprise.Net

Enterprise.Net is a .NET library for creating hierarchical, system-oriented architectures. It aims to simplify the development of complex systems by providing a structured approach to task management and message routing. It's an evolution of the [Apollo](https://github.com/) library.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Design**: Create systems with top-level managers, mid-level managers, and workers.
- **Task Management**: Efficiently manage tasks and distribute workloads.
- **Message Routing**: Effectively route messages between different levels of the hierarchy.
- **Scalability**: Build scalable and maintainable architectures.
- **Adaptable**: Suitable for microservices, distributed systems, and organized monoliths.
